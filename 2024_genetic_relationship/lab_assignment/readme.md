## Data files for lab assignment
1. **Pine**. This dataset is a subset of individuals from [Resende et al 2012](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.111.137026). The individuals are derived from crosses between two out of four parents. Between any two individuals, they could be full-siblings, half-siblings or unrelated.  
    + pine_geno.csv: genomic marker data (coded as 0/1/2/NA) for 58 individuals and 4,853 markers.  
    + pine_ped.csv: pedigree data for 58 individuals and 4 parents.  

2. **Oat**. This dataset is a subset of lines from [Tinker et al 2014](https://doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2014.03.0010). There are three classifications for the lines: Spring Canada (CA), Spring US, and Winter US. As you may already know, spring oat does not require vernalization but winter oat does.  
    + oat_geno.csv: genomic marker data (coded as 0/1/2/NA) for 535 lines and 3,487 markers.  
    + oat_info.csv: grouping information for 535 lines.
